1. virtual spring control --> workspace safety

1.1 barrier function phi(x) = f(x) + r*B(x)
B(x) is the barrier function

1.2 penalty functions
the further away from barrier function, the harder the function will be penalized

2. SLP- sequential linear programming
solve nonlinear optimization problems with a series of linear programming programming

3. QP
good for real time implementation
--humanoid robot- hierachical problems- contact-balance-movement...

4. GA - generic algorithm / evolutionary algorithm

5. Particle Swarm Optimization -- bat flock simulation

6. Pareto Optimality -- more than one objective functions
